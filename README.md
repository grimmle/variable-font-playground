# Variable Font Playground

Use this app to test out and play with your fonts. Simply drag 'n drop your font files anywhere on screen to get started. Local processing with [opentype.js](https://github.com/opentypejs/opentype.js) allows you to get the variation axes of any variable font. Choose from predefined presets or tweak them to your liking. Further you can alter font size, line height, letter spacing and color.
